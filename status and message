You either live in love or die, there is no way in between!

I am single because god is busy writing to best love story for me 

The space between your fingers are meant to be filled with mine.

My one hand is enough to fight against the world... If you hold the other one.

Only Love takes you to heaven without the dying part.

There are three sides to an argument â€“ your side, my side and the right side.

Sometimes you succeed... and other times you learn.
